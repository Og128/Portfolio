Additionally, styled-components help enormously with site construction. As for Hooks, only useState and useEffect were useful in the project."

                "textlearn": "In this project I learned how to be a scrum master to lead my team using the agile project management through the project. I also learned how to use the website 'Trello' to create a Kanban that will list the different User stories to build for the website. While doing that I learned a lot about how to build a website, which language to use to build it, what is the difference between a hosting server and a database and a lot more !",

As for the agile methodology and the users stories, a life-size exercise with my friends allowed me to understand the system well."
